# Portal Base

Python script to serach for specific keywords in Portal Base from Portugal.

Portal Base https://www.base.gov.pt/ is a Portuguese website from the Government where all public contracts are avaiable. I used this script to serach for keywords like Cycleways and the Tax Number from the Municipal Company responsbile for the Cycleways, in order to understand if there were news on sustainable mobility in Lisbon.
This script creates an URL with the variables you fill and return the data from new contracts in the last 24h, to a CSV and then post the results into a Slack Channel.

Modify it as you wish so it can be useful for you.
